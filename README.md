# C# Email Input Validator

A dedicated **C# Console Utility** focused on data integrity and input validation. This project demonstrates how to implement robust logic to verify user-provided email addresses, ensuring they follow standard formats before being processed by a system.

## 🚀 Key Learning Outcomes & Skills

By building this validator, I practiced several essential backend development concepts:

- **Pattern Matching:** Implementing logic to detect specific characters (like '@' and '.') and their correct positioning within a string.
- **String Manipulation:** Using C# string methods to parse and analyze user input effectively.
- **Error Handling:** Providing clear, real-time feedback to users when an invalid format is detected, preventing "garbage data" from entering the application.
- **Looping & Control Flow:** Creating a persistent input loop that allows users to retry until a valid format is achieved.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** C#
- **Framework:** .NET 8
- **Application Type:** Console Utility

## 📝 Project Motivation

In enterprise software development, data is only as good as its validation. I built this utility to sharpen my skills in **Data Integrity**, a core principle at companies like **TechnologyOne**. Understanding how to clean and validate input at the entry point is crucial for building secure and reliable SaaS platforms.
